This project involves object detection with the Raspberry Pi 4.
A LED matrix will be used to communicate to the user when a train is approaching. To detect an approaching train, a camera will analyse images and live video and transmit it back to the Pi, which then communicates to the matrix. Further plans include a speaker system to provide an auditory experience.
